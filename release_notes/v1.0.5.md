# Release v1.0.5

## Changes

Here are the changes since v1.0.3:

- Add [Tinkers' Tool Leveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling).
  - This mod makes Tinkers' Construct (and Construct's Armory) busted and overpowered... which is a lot of fun to me!
- Add [MiniHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud), which has a light level overlay feature.
- Replace [VeinBreaker](https://modrinth.com/mod/veinbreaker) with [VeinMiner](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/veinminer), for the following reasons:
  - VeinBreaker is buggy with mods.
  - VeinBreaker ignores Silk Touch or similar modded enchants.
  - VeinBreaker does not give users experience.
  - VeinMiner is open-source software.
- Add the [InstantUnify](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/instantunify) and [UniDict](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unidict) mods.
  - These take the 9,000 variants of Copper Ore, Silver Ore, etc. to unify them into one tile drop + machine output.
- Fix a bunch of overlapping keybinds.
- Include decent defaults for Video Settings, Controls, etc.
- Remove OpenBlocks mod due to crashes.
  - A dependency, `OpenModsLib`, was causing dependency injection to fail -- which crashed the game.
