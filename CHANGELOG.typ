= Changelog

Here's a list of all changes made to the modpack. Older changes are lower in the list.

== v1.0.5

- Add #link("https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling")[Tinkers' Tool Leveling].
  - This mod makes Tinkers' Construct (and Construct's Armory) busted and overpowered... which is a lot of fun to me!
- Add #link("https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud")[MiniHUD], which has a light level overlay feature.
- Replace #link("https://modrinth.com/mod/veinbreaker")[VeinBreaker] with #link("https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/veinminer")[VeinMiner], for the following reasons:
  + VeinBreaker is buggy with mods.
  + VeinBreaker ignores Silk Touch or similar modded enchants.
  + VeinBreaker does not give users experience.
  + VeinMiner is open-source software.
- Add the #link("https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/instantunify")[InstantUnify] and #link("https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unidict")[UniDict] mods.
  - These take the 9,000 variants of Copper Ore, Silver Ore, etc. to unify them into one tile drop + machine output.
- Fix a bunch of overlapping keybinds
- Include decent defaults for Video Settings, Controls, etc.

== v1.0.4

- Remove OpenBlocks mod due to crashes.
  - A dependency, `OpenModsLib`, was causing dependency injection to fail -- which crashed the game.

== v1.0.3

- Remove Portal Gun mod, as it's not redistributable.
  - The pack isn't distributable on Modrinth with this mod in, unfortunately.
- Add OpenBlocks mod.

== v1.0.2

- Initial modpack.
